As a health care professional with a unique outlook on therapeutics, Iysha provides quality rehabilitative care to her clients through somatics, movement therapy and yoga therapy.

In a one-on-one setting, Iysha provides structured care to her clients using evidence-based approaches to physical rehabilitation. Iysha provides clients with stability and mindful strengthening exercises for muscles/muscle groups that require strength and tone, as well as specific mobility exercises for areas in the body that are stiff and lack range of motion. She specializes in lower back health, SIJ issues, overall pelvic/hip health, deep core/abdominal strengthening protocols, and general chronic pain management. In addition, Iysha has also trained in Trauma-Informed settings and helps clients who suffer from anxiety and depression through a series of self-regulation tools for the nervous system, that include breathing, meditation and movement.

In a group setting, Iysha is committed to providing empowering and transformative therapeutic movement and yoga classes to students of all levels, creating an anatomically, mentally and emotionally healing experience.
